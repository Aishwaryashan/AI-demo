College is a time of great change and opportunity. It's important to stay focused on your goals, but also to be open to new experiences. Whether it's trying out for a new club or taking a challenging class, stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to great rewards. At the same time, it's important to remember that college can be overwhelming at times, and it's okay to take a break and focus on self-care.
